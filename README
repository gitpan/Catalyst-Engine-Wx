Catalyst/Engine/Wx
===============================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

MORE INFO

This is the Catalyst engine specialized for building non-blocking and
multi-platforms desktop applications with the Catalyst framework. It
allows to tie Wx events to Catalyst controllers asychronously (thank you
POE).

Hopefully it will make possible to re-use the Models and Controllers
of a Catalyst web application when you want to build a desktop application.

Hopefully it will also make possible the opposite.

There is now a demo application, you can run it and see how it behaves. 
It is loosely inspired by the tutorial of Catalyst on CPAN.

Thanks for your comments.
