Catalyst/Engine/Wx
===============================

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

MORE INFO

This is the Catalyst engine specialized for building non-blocking and
multi-platforms desktop applications with the Catalyst framework. It
allows to tie Wx events to Catalyst controllers asychronously (thank you
POE).

Hopefully it will make possible to re-use the Models and Controllers
of a Catalyst web application when you want to build a desktop application.

Hopefully it will also make possible the opposite.

Anyway, there is no sample application yet so you can see how things goes with
the tests.

Thanks for your comments.
